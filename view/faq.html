                                <h6>What is the purpose of the KidVision Pre-K website</h6>
                                <p>It is a professional development website for prekindergarten teachers to learn and teach education standards for 4-year-old children. It is an aide for parents to keep their children on track to be academically prepared to start kindergarten.</p>
                                <h6>What standards does KidVision Pre-K cover?</h6>
                                <p>KidVision Pre-K stays current with The National Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework. Before the 2017- 2018 school year KidVision Pre-K targeted Florida Early Learning and Developmental Standards for 4-year-olds (2011). The Florida standards align with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework. Both sets of standards and a cross-walk comparing them are available on the Teacher Development page.</p>
                                <p>Also, on the Teacher Development page is a link to most state early learning standards. For your information, most state standards use the Head Start Learning Outcomes Framework as a skeleton to build their standards from. Thereby, KidVision Pre-K content is a valuable tool for all states to use as a standards learning and teaching tool.</p>
                                <h6>What are in-service hours and CEUs?</h6>
                                <p>In-Service hours are training hours connected to early childhood subjects. This yearly training is required by most states for childcare personnel who have fulfilled the requirements for teaching preschool and are actively teaching, in order for them to stay current with preschool teaching practices. CEUs (Continuing Education Units) are a block of 10 accumulated In-Service Hours. Ten In-Service Hours equal one CEU.</p>
                                <h6>Is KidVision Pre-K an approved training for annual in-service hours and CEUs?</h6>
                                <p>Yes. We have partnered with FACCM (Florida Association for Child Care Management) to issue IACET (International Association for Continuing Education and Training) CEUs. The FACCM organization is recognized nationally.</p>
                                <p>According to Florida Statutes, “On an annual basis, in order to further their childcare skills, childcare personnel who have fulfilled the requirements for child care training shall be required to take an additional 1 continuing education unit (CEU) of approved in-service training, or 10-clock-hours of equivalent training.</p>
                                <h6>Beside CEUs and In-Service Hours what does the Teacher Association offer?</h6>
                                <p>Membership in the KidVision Teachers Association offers preschool teachers the opportunity to earn CEUs and In-Service Hours. Additionally, teachers become a member of a ‘professional early childhood association’ required by CDA and other organizations. As a member you also receive a monthly electronic newsletter. Members can write articles for the newsletter as a professional task required for many renewals. And can join the KidVision PreK Teachers Facebook page, which offers added current information and rewards.</p>
                                <h6>Can In-Service Hours and CEUs be earned every year or only one time for each field trip?</h6>
                                <p>Field Trip units can be used every year. Each year on July 1st KidVision Pre-K resets it's website so early childhood educators can use the field trips again and take the tests again on the standards. Earning credits to fulfill the new year requirements.</p>
                                <h6>How can the in-service and CEU’s be valid for another year if it was done the year before?</h6>
                                <p>Each year teachers have new students and each year teachers need to review the standards they are responsible to teach. The field trips are useable in the classroom every year, for example October is Fire Safety Month, so every October our field trip to the Fire Station is useful.</p>
                                <h6>How does KidVision Pre-K fit into the Florida Core Competencies for Early Care & Education Practitioners, knowing that other states also have similar Core Competencies?</h6>
                                <p>KidVision Pre-K satisfies Core Knowledge Area 5: Curriculum. A. Understand content knowledge in early childhood education. Tier I. #1. Identify appropriate Early Learning and Developmental Standards for 4-Year-Olds. Tier II. #3. Demonstrate knowledge of the Early Learning and Developmental Standards for 4-Year-Olds in content areas including language, literacy, math, science, social studies, art, music, drama, and movement. Tier III. #8. Plan and implement activities and experiences that support all children’s attainment of the Early Learning and Developmental Standards for 4-Year-Olds. And Tier IV. #10. Integrate the Early Learning and Developmental Standards for 4-Year-Olds in curriculum planning.</p>
                                <h6>What is the best way to show KidVision Pre-K field trips in the classroom?</h6>
                                <p>The best way to do it is to look at your monthly themes, consider which field trips match and/or enhance your themes, then show them to your students and do the lesson plans and assessments during that time frame.</p>
                                <h6>Are the Take Home Pages coloring pages?</h6>
                                <p>Yes and No, they are literacy prompting worksheets. KidVision Pre-K Take Home Pages serve as an extra literacy-learning bonus included with every unit because literacy learning is a priority. There is a Direction Sheet included in each Take Home Page packet that gives teachers and parents specific directions on how to use the sheet with their children to improve early literacy skills. These skills include letter naming and sounds, language and communication, listening comprehension, vocabulary, and handwriting.</p>
                                <h6>What is the appropriate and intended use of the KidVision Pre-K system?</h6>
                                <p>The intension of KidVision Pre-K is that it is not a stand-alone training. It is embedded in classroom instructional practices, so that standards are targeted and integrated into curriculum. A teacher may watch several videos at one sitting to earn her in-service hours and CEUs to get them done, but that does not mean that she is not going to use what she has learned to implement new knowledge in the classroom. She is taking away information that is valuable to her job, standards information that she is accountable to teach. Anyone can walk away from a training and that is that. This training is there for her to take the test now but show the virtual field trip later in the classroom when it fits her curriculum theme and use the lesson plans and assessments then when they benefit her students the most. If the teacher does not have Internet in her classroom, she can still use the lesson plans and assessments to target and teach Florida standards with any curriculum.</p>
                                <h6>What is KidVision 1-2-3?</h6>
                                <p>KidVision 1-2-3 is an extension of KidVision PreK. KidVision 1-2-3 provides lesson plans and assessments for ages 18-to-24-month-olds, 2-year-olds and 3-year-olds for each field trip. These lesson plans and assessments are developmentally sequential building toward the provided 4-year-old lesson plans and assessments.</p>
